Great question — you're now asking:

> ✅ **"How to see through the inspect menu the listeners (like JavaScript event listeners that block Ctrl+C)?"**

This is a very practical and insightful step — because **if you can see what JavaScript is blocking Ctrl+C**, you can understand *exactly* how the site is preventing copying.

Let’s walk through **how to find and inspect event listeners** (like those blocking `Ctrl+C`) in the browser's DevTools (Inspect menu).

## 🔍 Step-by-Step: How to See JavaScript Event Listeners That Block Ctrl+C

You can use **Browser DevTools** (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) to find JavaScript code that listens to keyboard events (like `keydown`) and prevents copy.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Open Developer Tools
- Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I**.
- Go to the **Elements** tab (or just keep it open).

---

### ✅ Step 2: Go to the **Console** or **Event Listeners** Tab

#### 🔹 Option A: Check for `keydown` listeners in the Console
1. In the **Console** tab, type:
   ```js
   document.querySelectorAll('body').forEach(el => {
       console.log('Event listeners on body:', [...el.addEventListener]);
   });
   ```
   > ⚠️ This won’t work directly — we need a better method.

#### 🔹 Option B: Use the **Event Listeners** Tab (Best Method)

👉 **Go to the "Event Listeners" tab** in DevTools (you might need to click on it or press `Ctrl+Shift+E`).

> This tab shows **all event listeners** attached to elements in the page.

#### 🔍 How to use the Event Listeners tab:
1. In the **Elements** tab, click on any element (e.g., the body, or a container).
2. Switch to the **Event Listeners** tab (in the left sidebar).
3. Look for:
   - `keydown`
   - `keypress`
   - `keyup`
4. Click on any `keydown` listener and inspect it.

🔍 You’ll see something like:
```js
function(event) {
    if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === 'c') {
        event.preventDefault();
        return false;
    }
}
```

✅ If you see this, that’s **exactly** the code that blocks Ctrl+C.

> 🔎 This is the most direct way to **see what's blocking Ctrl+C**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Search for "copy" or "ctrl+c" in JavaScript
In the **Sources** tab (or Console), search for:
- `"ctrl+c"`
- `"copy"`
- `"preventDefault"`
- `"keydown"`

Example:
1. Press `Ctrl+F` in the Console or Sources tab.
2. Type: `ctrl+c` or `preventDefault`
3. Look for any function that does:
   ```js
   if (e.ctrlKey && e.key === 'c') e.preventDefault();
   ```

> This confirms the block.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Temporarily Disable the Block (Testing Only)

⚠️ This is **not recommended for production** — only for testing.

You can **temporarily disable** the script to test if Ctrl+C works.

#### How to do it:
1. In the **Sources** tab, find the JavaScript file that blocks Ctrl+C.
2. Right-click on the script → **"Disable"** (or "Toggle Breakpoint").
3. Refresh the page.
4. Try pressing **Ctrl+C** — it should now work!

> 🚨 This only works if the site doesn’t have other protections (like content monitoring).

---

### ✅ Step 5: Use a Browser Extension to Bypass (Optional)

Extensions like:
- **Copy with Ctrl+C**
- **Copy to Clipboard**
- **Ctrl+C Bypass**

Inject JavaScript to **override** or **disable** copy blockers.

> These work **only if the site doesn’t detect or block extensions**.

---

## 🎯 Summary: How to See What’s Blocking Ctrl+C

| Step | What to Do |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Open DevTools (F12) → **Event Listeners** tab |
| 2 | Click on `<body>` or a container element |
| 3 | Look for `keydown` or `keypress` listeners |
| 4 | Find any code that checks `ctrlKey && key === 'c'` |
| 5 | Look for `preventDefault()` or `return false` |
| 6 | Use Console search: `ctrl+c`, `preventDefault` |
| 7 | (Optional) Disable the script to test |

---

## 🔍 Example Output You Might See
In the Event Listeners tab:
```
Event: keydown
Handler: function(e) {
    if (e.ctrlKey && e.key === 'c') {
        e.preventDefault();
        return false;
    }
}
```

✅ This confirms the site is blocking Ctrl+C.

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: Try Ctrl+Shift+C
Even if Ctrl+C is blocked, **Ctrl+Shift+C** (copy selected text) is often **not blocked** — try it!

> It’s a common alternative used by many sites.

---

## Final Notes
- You **cannot force** a website to allow Ctrl+C — they control their own copy policies.
- But you **can see** exactly what JavaScript is blocking it — using DevTools.
- You can **test** disabling the block (for learning).
- You can **work around** it using mouse selection or extensions.
