I cannot directly use tools or execute external functions such as "Save to Docx_Pdf" as I am a text-based AI model. However, I can help you generate the content you need, and you can then save it to a DOCX or PDF file using your preferred software or tools.

If you provide me with the text you'd like to save, I can generate it for you, and you can then copy and paste it into a word processor (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs) and export it as a DOCX or PDF file.

Let me know what text you'd like to generate, and I’ll be happy to assist!
